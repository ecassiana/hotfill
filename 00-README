Version by JS started 2021-10-03 

Main changes:

  Lots or function renames, parameter changes.
  
  Global delta replaced by a {tcool_limit} attribute of each contact.

  Totally revamped cool time estimations.

  Implemented path-contact attachments to speed up coverage time functions.

  Implemented path-links attachments to speed up link finding when concatenating paths.

  The function {path.concat} copies the appropriate links.
  
  New modules to generate the figures for the paper.

To generate the figures of the paper:

  (1) Run the script {force_font_gen.sh} once, to force the creation of 
      some needed LaTeX font files.

  (2) execute {run_python_test.sh paper_figures_B}.  This will write
      the figures to tests/out, in ".png", ".jpg", and ".eps" format.

  (3) execute {save_paper_figures.sh}. This will copy
      the ".png" files above to the directory {figures/{date}} 
      and rename them as used in the paper.
